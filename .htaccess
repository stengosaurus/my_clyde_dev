# This will show a number but it will not give away the column name in your table
# To have cleaner URL's is is better to use a framework

# In PHP, the [L] flag at the end of a RewriteRule is used in conjunction with the Apache 
# mod_rewrite module.

# The [L] flag stands for "last" and is used to indicate that the current rule should 
# be the last one applied if it matches. When mod_rewrite processes a URL, it goes through all of the RewriteRules in order, and if a rule matches, it will apply the corresponding rewrite and start over again with the modified URL.

# By using the [L] flag, you can tell mod_rewrite to stop processing rules if the current
#  rule matches, effectively preventing any further rewrites from being applied. 
#  This can be useful in situations where you have multiple RewriteRules that could 
#  potentially match a URL, but you only want one of them to be applied.
